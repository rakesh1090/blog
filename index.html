It was a very happy&nbsp;Sunday for me since it was a first parent meet. I was playing cricket and I came back to my house and surprised to see my parents were already there. They were sitting on my cot and were unpacking the sweets! I asked them how did they locate my cot. They said it was the only cot in the house which was looking like a junk bin and for them, it was not a surprise because definitely, that cot would be mine. I still remember my first parent meeting. I still cherish all those moments because some things will never be forgotten and they are JNV things.<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The best thing about jnv is I didn't have anything but still, I had everything. In the name of friends, I had some people. Friends being family in Jnv use to share everything. when it comes to porn wherever we were, we used to unite and watch. Even low-quality porn of 3 minutes had a goddamn value in that place. From juniors we became seniors. Being a senior in Jnv was a privilege. it's like finding the pleasure in everything. Most of the unwanted things on earth happened when we were seniors.</div>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As days were rolling we were about to complete the 11th class. As usual Aravali boys were busy in fapping. Some of the Neelagiri boys were so much indulged in a study that there was no need of entertainment for them. They used to masturbate their mind by studying the hard concepts of integrals and differentials . Under the safe hands of Marisamy sir and Sharma sir, Shivalik and Udayagiri boys were doing good except for few days when these boys went to build a car shed for Sharma sir. Everybody and everything was going good. One day my friend got caught in an unwanted act and the school authorities were not happy with him so they wanted to rusticate him. We were sitting in the class and got the news about that. Suddenly without a second thought, we went to strike back at the authority. I still remember that late evening as it was hard and full of ambiguity. We all went to the principal's chamber and sat in front of it. We were not listening to anyone and sat there fuckin five minutes. Everybody was looking like unsung heroes until Sharma sir came. Mr. Sharma was a man of strategy. He knew how to break things. He asked us to stop but nobody was looking and listening to him. Finally, he started calling our names. When it comes to individuals responsibly everything sucks. he yelled "ye singadi ba illi" and continued to call everyone. He called everyone's parents and told them to come ASAP. My parents were very near and they came within an hour. My dad along with my sister went to enquire. My sister went on to orgue with the principal. I was so proud of her that her LLB skills were absolutely stunning. Other parents were also angry because of the situation. The principal asked them to come tomorrow. My dad was super cool. He told me to be happy and worry about nothing as he would sort the things tomorrow. That night our hostel grills were locked in order to avoid communication.&nbsp;&nbsp;I slept happily because my father didn't blame me and I was very much proud of myself but what fate always wanted was to fuck me.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next day I found myself singing "Ham navayug ki nayi Bharati " with very enthusiasm in the morning assembly and I never did that before. As classes started we were called to come and sit in the garden. We went there sat and I observed all the parents were gathered in the principal chamber. My father was there too. After one hour all the parents came out. I saw my father's face and something was not right. He came to me and asked, "nind exam marks yast biddav".&nbsp; I never anticipated that . Actually, I had never told the marks before. There were so many who had never told their marks to their parents and unfortunately the principal used that bloody weapon on us. I got to know that every student's marks and behaviour were discussed in the chamber. Every parent was very disappointed by their children I believe mine too. I was astounded because yesterday everything was fine but today it was a boom. As usual, we were asked to submit an apology letter. I learned something "nothing can stop you from your parents except the fucking marks".<br />
